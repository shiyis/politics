## P.O.L.I.T.I.C.S. - A Political Opinions, Language, and Ideology Text Interpretation and Classification Solution
This exploratory independent capstone project tries to offer a solution that dynamically measures political subjectivity with Variational Autoencoding methods through quantifying an author's political leaning (their political position gets projected onto a one dimensional scale as an ideal point that ranges from moderate to progressive).

### Dynamically Measuring Political Opinions and Subjectivity with VAE

Drawing inspiration from one of the studies conducted on measuring political subjectivity and quantifying author's political stance through variational inference, this project will largely follow [this paper](https://github.com/keyonvafa/tbip) to conduct an ad hoc analysis and unsupervised modeling over political content in the format of tweets for eliciting  interpretable results.

A simple EDA (What Is An [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://medium.com/@lamsampathkumar0/eda-exploratory-data-analysis-project-using-python-de90cbf4e128)?) will also be carried out in supporting the final analysis.

### Data Collection and Organization
This [repo](https://github.com/shiyis/project-inputs) serves as a sample data collection demo.
(p.s. due to limited permissions of twitter API access, some of the data collected might not be as ideal). The data collection process involves using the Twitter API academic access and building a small tweet retrieving pipeline for the tweets.
